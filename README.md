# Music-Store
Music Store JSP application 
Base code provided by publication: 
Murach, J. & Urban, M. (2014). Murach's Java Servlets and JSP, 3rd Edition. Mike Murach and Associates, LLC.

This program is the culmination of an entire JSP course.
Each component to this website was coded in individual modules.  
Each module began with a corrected version (or correct base) of the previous module's assignment.
Therefore, this program was coded by me, but the bulk of the final code presented was provided in the final module for consistency.

There are a limited number files shared because of limited space compared to the programs size.
These are meant to show an understanding of JSPs, controllers, and database integration.
